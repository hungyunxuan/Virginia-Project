# Virginia-Machine-Learning-Project
Machine Learning Project: Poverty Level Determinant in Virginia 

This project was done as part of ML4VA project in University of Virginia. A data source was obtained online and appropriate features were selected after cleaning, pre-processing and feature engineering the data. Algorithms such as linear, logistic regression, decision trees, clustering and support vector machine were trained to determine the geographical location of Virginia residents who would need to most help during difficult times like a natural disaster.
